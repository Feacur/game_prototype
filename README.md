# Summary
making a game prototype

# Instructions
### Source and data
```
framework .... lower-level layer; OS interface, graphics interface; universal framework code
application .. middle-level layer; abstracts OS interaction, based on framework layer; provides universal game loop
prototype .... higher-level layer; game code, based on application layer; non-universal-yet code
third_party .. third-party code; some specifications
assets ....... binary data for the prototype layer
project ...... build scripts, debug scripts; target translation units; current changes, future plans
```

### IDE
```
__sublime_project ... project, intellisense, reference settings
__vscode_workspace .. project, intellisense, reference settings

you are free to use any other IDE, it's just me who didn't supply additional project files/options
```

### Compile and launch
> Manual:
1) from the project root, open `project`
2) run `build_clang.bat` or `build_msvc.bat`
3) from the project root, run `bin/game.exe`  
   N.B. code expects `assets` folder right at the current working directory

> IDE:
1) open ST4 or VSCode
2) launch one of the build/debug/run commands  
   N.B. debugging in Sublime Text relies on [RemedyBG](https://remedybg.itch.io/remedybg)
